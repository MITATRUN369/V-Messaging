*High-Level Architecture:**

1. **Image Verification Module**:
	* Uses metadata extraction from images to verify authenticity.
	* Performs web search using Google Vision API or similar services.
	* Calculates hash values of the images and compares them with stored hashes in the database.
2. **AI Image Verification Agent**:
	* Trained on a dataset of authentic and AI-generated images to learn patterns and features.
	* Uses machine learning algorithms (e.g., convolutional neural networks) to analyze image metadata, timestamps, and 
search results.
3. **Database**:
	* Stores image hashes, metadata, and timestamps for future verification.
	* Used to cache search results from Google Vision API or similar services.

**Proposed Code Structure:**

We'll use Python as the primary programming language. We'll break down the code into smaller modules, each handling 
a specific aspect of the application.

**Designing the AI Model:**

For training the AI model, we'll focus on detecting fake images and videos, as well as identifying suspicious text 
patterns. We'll use a combination of machine learning algorithms and techniques to achieve this.

Some potential approaches for the AI model include:

1. **Deep Learning:** Use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to analyze image 
and video features.
2. **Computer Vision:** Utilize libraries like OpenCV to extract metadata, detect objects, and analyze visual 
patterns.
3. **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Employ techniques like sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, and text 
classification to identify suspicious text patterns.

Some potential datasets for training the AI model include:

1. **ImageNet:** A large-scale dataset of images with labels indicating authenticity or fake status.
2. **Deepfake Detection Dataset:** A specialized dataset containing images and videos that have been manipulated 
using AI.
3. **Social Media Data:** Collect data from social media platforms to analyze patterns of suspicious text, image, 
and video sharing.

**Secure Peer-to-Peer Messaging Application:**

For the messaging app, we'll focus on creating a secure and scalable architecture with bare-bones features 
initially. We can add more features later as needed.

Some potential approaches for the messaging app include:

1. **End-to-End Encryption:** Use public-key cryptography to encrypt messages, ensuring confidentiality and 
integrity.
2. **Secure Key Exchange:** Utilize public-key exchange protocols like Diffie-Hellman or Elliptic Curve 
Cryptography to establish secure connections between peers.
3. **Peer Discovery:** Implement a peer discovery mechanism using DNS or WebSockets to facilitate connection 
establishment.

**Initial Design:**

Here's an initial design for the messaging app and AI model:

1. **User Interface:** Create a clean, minimalistic interface with features like:
	* Real-time chat log
	* Video call functionality
	* File sharing (images, videos)
2. **AI Model:** Develop an AI model that can detect fake images and videos using a combination of machine learning 
algorithms and computer vision techniques.
3. **Data Storage:** Use a database to store user data, messages, and AI-generated hashes for future verification.

**Code Structure:**

We'll use Python as the primary programming language for both the AI model and messaging app. We can structure our 
code into separate modules like:

1. `ai_model.py`: Contains functions for training and deploying the AI model.
2. `message_app.py`: Handles user interface, message sending, and reception.
3. `database.py`: Manages data storage and retrieval.
